# seat-600-identifier
Identifier for SEAT 600 and other variants

This tool will allow users to identify their SEAT 600 & variants according to the Chassis and Engine numbers manually entered by them.

It will also display these elements which changed or were improved during the model production. Most of these changes where gradually introduced on the assembly line, so identifying which part/component is the original is useful for a full restoriation project.
